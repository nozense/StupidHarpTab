# StupidHarpTab
Just a stupid Harmonica tab parser

## Purpose

To add easily understandable characters to indicate note length in tabs,
without making the raw tabs hard to follow,
and to draw these out using simple php and css.

## Tab syntax

Notation | Explanation
 ------------ | -------------
"4"   | Four Blow
"(4)" | Four Draw
":4" | Sixteeth note
".4" | Eighth note
"4" | Quater note (i.e no marking)
"4." | Half note
"4:" | Full note
